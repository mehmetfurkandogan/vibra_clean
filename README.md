# VibraClean Project

Welcome to the VibraClean project repository! This project was developed for the course ME420 - Advanced Design for Sustainable Future at EPFL. Our goal is to rethink the way we clean our food and create a device that helps clean food in a sustainable way. We approached sustainability from a design perspective, focusing on creating a sustainable solution by design rather than relying on recycling materials.

## Project Overview

VibraClean aims to provide an innovative and sustainable method for cleaning food. By leveraging advanced design principles, we have developed a device that ensures efficient and eco-friendly cleaning processes.

## Repository Contents

This repository contains the various codes required for the VibraClean project, including:

- **Microcontroller Code**: Code for the ESP32 microcontroller that controls the device.
- **Web-Based User Interface**: HTML files for the web-based user interface that allows users to interact with the device.
- **System Identification**: Python scripts for system identification purposes.
